# In some cases, the actors are obvious.
# The actor can be just one person, like a one-player video game, which is the player
# Sometimes the actors are more than one person, such as educational applications, which consist of a teacher and a student or more, depending on the application
# The primary actors aren't necessarily the most important actor in the scenario.
