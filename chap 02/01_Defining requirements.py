# The first step to any design process is to gather your requirements
# What we're doing here, defining requirements, has nothing to do with object orientation
# On the first pass, only focus on capturing the absolute minimum set of requirements.
# Not the things that are optional, or nice to have. Just the bare necessities, your minimum viable product
