# Every object has characteristics, inherent properties that describe its current state
# Most objects have multiple attributes. Some of those attributes like color and size will remain constant.
# Whereas other attributes like whether it's True or False are likely to change
# Identity, attributes, and behaviors describe objects in an object-oriented programming language.
# In programming, the idea of an object extends further to describe non-tangible things too. Like a date, a timer, or a bank account.
